    "question": "What is ARTSENS",
    "answer": "**Introduction**\nARTSENS Plus PWV is a medical device designed for clinical and research settings. As an expert biomedical assistant, I will provide a comprehensive overview of ARTSENS Plus PWV, drawing from the hierarchical context provided.\n**Key Findings**\nAccording to the documentation, ARTSENS Plus PWV is intended for use on adults only, with safety and effectiveness in children below 18 years old not established. The device is designed for clinical or research settings and should not be used as a continuous monitoring device in hospitals or emergency vehicles. Additionally, it is not intended for outdoor use or individual transport.\nThe device does not contain confidential information of significance, and no specific steps are required for secure decommissioning. However, the host PC may require decommissioning according to hospital policy after patient report data backup has been taken.\n**Clinical Implications**\nARTSENS Plus PWV is designed to supplement, not substitute, the clinician's decision-making process. It should be used in conjunction with knowledge of the patient's history and other clinical findings. The device should not be used for patients with erratic or compromised circulation, as this may cause further injury.\n**Conclusion**\nIn summary, ARTSENS Plus PWV is a medical device intended for use on adults only, designed for clinical or research settings. It does not contain confidential information of significance, and no specific steps are required for secure decommissioning. The device should be used in conjunction with the clinician's decision-making process and should not be used for patients with compromised circulation.\nNote: The provided context is truncated due to length limits; however, I have synthesized the relevant information across different abstraction levels to provide a comprehensive answer.\n\n**Sources consulted:**\nâ€¢ Unknown source",
